# INTROSPECTION
## Why must we choose you?
when I studied java in class 10 and C++ in my 11th and 12th I found it very intresting and I noticed that computer science is the only subject which never bores my no matter what. I am always ready to do something in computer science and anything related to tech.
## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I always wanted to be an full stack android and iOS developer and after seeing flutter i am seeing this as a great path towards my dream job beacause of its cross compatiblity. So i would like to focus on app dev along with DSA and competitve along with some focus on academics so that i dont lose my scholarship.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I would like to give back to the club by dilligently performing every task given by the mentors and participating in some competition to make my club and college proud.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
 The selection process surely has some tasks which have a higher learning curve but this is very good because anyone who attempts the tasks develops a fighting spirit especially when  he/she is stuck somewhere. So in my opinion the tasks are very well structured and well presented.
