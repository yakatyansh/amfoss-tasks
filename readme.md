## My views about the tasks
I myself have not completed all the tasks so I cannot assure the fact myself that the tasks are easy. they are tough for sure. But being problem solvers if we are able to tackle all difficulties in the tasks we will surely succeed in performing atleast 10 tasks.The tasks are designed to cultivate the habit of self learning and develop a fighting spirit in which they are successful atleast in my case.
## My Introduction
Hii Seniors :pray: I am Yash Katyan from Patna Bihar.I came to know about amFOSS from quora since then it fascinated me.
My rejection from Tier 1 (IITs/NITs) colleges gave me a lot of pain and i was not feeling good. After all that I decided that I will perform as good  as the students of Tier 1 colleges and I believe that the club will help me a lot to acheive this dream of mine. In return i am ready to give my 200% into the club.
