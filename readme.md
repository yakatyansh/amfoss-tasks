## My views about the tasks
I myself have not completed all the tasks so i cannot directly say that they were easy but yaa they were not of that type that they 
would be out of the range of freshers.They were so amazing that i cannot have a particular word to describe them.They challange us to 
increase our knowledge that is the best part of it.The tasks are designed to cultivate the habit of self learning in which they are 
successful atleast in my case.
## My Introduction
Hii Seniors :pray: I am Yash Katyan from Patna Bihar.I came to know about amFOSS from quora since then it fascinated me.
I feel the club will provide me ample opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge.I am a noob in the field of coding and I only knew 
JAVA to an extent but after attempting the tasks I personally find a great improvement in my knowledge this is what I basically want from 
me that each day when I get up in the morning I find myself improved than the previous day and this is what doing the tasks i have achieved.
