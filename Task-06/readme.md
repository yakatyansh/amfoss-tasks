# Flutter UI 
 This was a very good task and in my opinion the most difficult and fun one. The 
 end of this task was the best part beacuse i saw my own app running on two 
 platforms(Namely iOS and android). It was a very satisfying feeling. Most of this 
 task for now was copy paste from flutter.dev and youtube. but i want to learn more 
 about dart and flutter.
